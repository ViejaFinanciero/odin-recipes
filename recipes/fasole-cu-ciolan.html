<h1>Fasole cu ciolan</h1>
<img src="fasole.jpg">
<h3>In Romania we call it “Ciorba de fasole boabe cu ciolan afumat”. 
    The word “ciorba” is improperly translated soup but there is no other English word to describe it. 
    “Ciorba” is actually a slightly sour soup composed by vegetables and sometimes meat. 
    To understand how important “ciorba” is in Romania you must think at the cheese for the french or the tea for the english.</h3>
<p>he recipe I’ve chosen is the one I found in the cookbook which is slightly different from the one my mother was doing. 
    Back home, my family was doing a hungarian type of bean soup which is not sour and it has a mix of wheat flour and oil that we call “rantas” (in France they call it roux). 
    I will try my family recipe when I’ll start an hungarian category. In the meantime let’s enjoy this romanian soup.</p>
<p>This bean soup it’s a romanian staple and I remember eating it since ever. There’s a saying in Maramures, 
    if you eat many beans during your childhood, you become a big and strong man. 
    I’m pretty sure my parents wanted me to become “the strongest man in the word”.</p>
